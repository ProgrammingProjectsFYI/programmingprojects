A DNS Forwarder is a nameserver that is used to resolve DNS queries locally instead of directly using the authoritative nameserver chain.

Often they sit on the edge of a local area network and provide DNS resolution to the computers on the local network, reducing external traffic and speeding up external access by serving the answer from a local cache.
