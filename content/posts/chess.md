What makes this an interesting programming project is the complexity of a game of chess. It’s widely agreed that to play well you need to be thinking at least five moves ahead. Doesn’t sound much, but with 30 legal moves per piece, there are a quadrillion possibilities to consider. If you could evaluate 10 million possibilities a second, it would take three years to evaluate them all!

Chess is a great testing ground for your data structure and algorithm skills
