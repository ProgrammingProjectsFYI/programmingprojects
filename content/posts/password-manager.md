A **password manager** is a tool to help users securely store, manage, and generate passwords. It simplifies the process of maintaining strong, unique passwords for multiple accounts by securely storing them in an encrypted database. Users only need to remember a single master password to access the password manager.

### Common Features Can Include:
1. **Password Storage**: Safely stores login credentials for websites, apps, and devices.
2. **Password Generation**: Creates strong, random passwords to enhance security.
3. **Autofill**: Automatically fills in login forms to save time and prevent keylogging attacks.
4. **Synchronization**: Syncs data across devices, ensuring access to passwords anywhere.
5. **Secure Sharing**: Allows users to share credentials securely with others when needed.

### Why Use One?
Password managers reduce the risk of using weak or reused passwords, which are common vulnerabilities in online security. They also protect against phishing attacks by ensuring passwords are only used on legitimate websites.
