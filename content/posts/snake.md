Snake was one of the first games that was available on a mobile phone - the Nokia 6110 in 1997!

Snake is a simple game where the player moves a snake around the playing grid at a fixed speed. Their goal is to eat the food that appears at random locations on the grid.

For each item of food eaten the snake becomes longer and the player scores points. The game ends when the snake hits the edge of the game grid or itâ€™s own body.
