This project is to build a YAML parser.

A YAML parser is a tool or library that reads and interprets data written in **YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)** format. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files, data exchange, and data storage. The parser processes YAML files, converts their content into data structures (like dictionaries or objects), and makes them accessible to programming languages for use in applications.

### Key Functions of a YAML Parser:
1. **Reading YAML Files:** Parses the syntax and structure of the YAML file.
2. **Validating YAML:** Ensures the file adheres to the YAML specification and reports syntax errors.
3. **Converting YAML to Data Structures:** Converts YAML data into native data structures like:
   - Python: dictionaries, lists, strings, etc.
   - JavaScript: objects, arrays, strings, etc.

### Common Use Cases:
- **Configuration Management:** Parsing configuration files for applications (e.g., `docker-compose.yml` or CI/CD pipelines).
- **Data Exchange:** Reading or writing data in YAML format for APIs or file sharing.
- **Automation Tools:** Tools like Ansible use YAML parsers to interpret playbooks.

### Example Libraries:
- **Python:** PyYAML, ruamel.yaml
- **JavaScript/Node.js:** js-yaml
- **Go:** gopkg.in/yaml.v3
- **Ruby:** YAML module (built-in)

By simplifying how structured data is handled, YAML parsers make it easier for developers to work with configuration and data files in a variety of programming environments.
