Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game that challenges players to uncover squares on a grid while avoiding hidden mines. It became popular as a default game included in Microsoft Windows operating systems.

### Gameplay:
1. **Objective**: Clear the entire grid by uncovering all non-mine squares without triggering a mine.
2. **Grid**: The board consists of a grid of squares, some of which contain hidden mines.
3. **Clues**: Numbers on uncovered squares indicate how many mines are adjacent to that square, helping players deduce safe squares.
4. **Mines**: Clicking on a mine ends the game.

### How to Play:
1. **Reveal Squares**: Click a square to uncover it.
2. **Mark Mines**: Right-click to flag squares suspected to contain mines.
3. **Logical Deduction**: Use numbers and patterns to deduce where mines are located.

### Key Features:
- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - Beginner: Small grid with fewer mines.
  - Intermediate: Medium grid with more mines.
  - Expert: Large grid with many mines.
  - Custom: Players can define the grid size and mine count.
- **Win Condition**: Successfully uncover all safe squares.
- **Lose Condition**: Clicking on a square with a mine.

### Strategies:
1. **Start in the Corners**: Corners or edges often provide helpful clues with fewer mines nearby.
2. **Flagging**: Mark known mines to avoid accidental clicks.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn common mine patterns, like "1-2-1" formations.
4. **Safe Zones**: Clicking empty areas (no adjacent mines) clears multiple squares at once.

### Legacy:
- **Popularity**: Bundled with Windows starting in the 1990s, Minesweeper became a nostalgic favorite for many.
- **Mental Challenge**: Encourages logical thinking and problem-solving.
- **Variants**: Many modern adaptations and clones expand the game with new mechanics or themes.

Minesweeper remains a timeless game, valued for its simplicity, strategic depth, and addictive gameplay.
