This challenge is to build your own Data Privacy Vault. It is a way to keep sensitive information safe. The vault stores the data and controls who can access it, making sure it's managed, watched over, and used appropriately.

Every business has sensitive data, whether it's about people's health (medical records), their payment details (credit card numbers), or other personal information (names and addresses).

At the same time every business wants and needs to leverage that data: analysing trends, processing payments, confirming someone's identity or simply delivering the product to the customer. The data is incredibly valuable so keeping it safe and secure is essential to the ongoing operation of a business as well as compliance with industry and legally required standards.

A data vault helps businesses achieve this by separating sensitive data and storing it in a secure service or ‘vault’. This vault then controls access to the data only when absolutely needed. Often the data is tokenised to allow it's use without being personally identifiable.
