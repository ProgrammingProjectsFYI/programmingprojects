**Memcached** is a high-performance, distributed memory caching system used to speed up dynamic web applications by reducing database load. It stores data in memory (RAM) as key-value pairs, making it extremely fast.

Here's an overview:

### Key Features:
- **Distributed Cache**: Can span multiple servers to handle large volumes of data.
- **In-memory Storage**: Operates entirely in RAM for low-latency data access.
- **Simple Key-Value Store**: Uses a straightforward key-value mechanism.
- **Scalable and Fast**: Supports horizontal scaling and can handle thousands of operations per second.

### Common Use Cases:
1. **Caching Database Queries**: Store frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, session data).
2. **Reducing Latency**: Speed up page loads by caching expensive or slow computations.
3. **Session Management**: Cache user sessions in web applications for quick retrieval.

### Limitations:
- **Volatile Storage**: Data is lost if the server restarts (not persistent).
- **No Advanced Query Capabilities**: Works best with simple key-value lookups.
- **Not a Database Replacement**: Designed to complement, not replace, a database.

Memcached is widely used in large-scale systems, such as social media platforms and e-commerce websites, to handle high traffic and deliver a fast user experience.

A CLI client allows a user to set and get the keys from the command line.
