This programming project is to build your own version of the GitHub contributions graph.

<!--more-->

The **GitHub contributions graph** is a visual representation of a user's activity on GitHub, shown as a grid of squares on their profile page. Each square represents a single day, and the color intensity reflects the amount of activity performed on that day.

### Key Features:
1. **Activity Tracking**: Highlights contributions made over the past year.
   - Activities include commits, pull requests, issues, and code reviews.
2. **Color Intensity**:
   - Lighter squares: Less activity.
   - Darker squares: More activity.
3. **Hover Information**: Hovering over a square shows the specific date and the number of contributions.

### Uses:
1. **Visualizing Engagement**: Helps track how consistently a user contributes to projects.
2. **Showcasing Skills**: Demonstrates involvement in open-source projects to potential employers or collaborators.
3. **Personal Motivation**: Encourages regular contributions by making progress visible.

### What Contributions Are Counted:
1. **Commits**: Pushing code changes to a GitHub repository.
2. **Pull Requests**: Submitting contributions to open-source or personal projects.
3. **Issues**: Reporting bugs or suggesting features.
4. **Code Reviews**: Reviewing and commenting on pull requests.
5. **Repositories**: Contributions to public or private repositories you own or collaborate on.
