Build your own API Rate Limiter, ready to sit in front of your API.

<!--more-->

This challenge is to build your own API rate limiter.

Rate limiters are a key part of building an API or large scale distributed system, they help when we wish to throttle traffic based on the user. They allow you to ensure that bad actors canâ€™t accidentally or deliberately overload the service.
