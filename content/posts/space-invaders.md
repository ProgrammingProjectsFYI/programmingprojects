2. **Aliens**: The invaders move side to side and descend gradually, increasing in speed as more are eliminated.
3. **Obstacles**: Shields are provided to protect the cannon but can be destroyed by both the aliens' and player's shots.
4. **Lives**: Players have a limited number of lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost or the aliens reach the bottom.
